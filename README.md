# mKOST
Modified Kepler Orbital Simulation Toolkit

This is mKOST: the Modified Kepler Orbital Simulation Toolkit. It won't cost you anything. It is based on the original KOST 0.75 code and was modified for my personnal joy and my pet projects.

mKOST will help you deal with orbital mechanics and related issues in your computer programs. It currently contains the following modules:

	* Linear algebra: Basic linear algebra for 3D vectors and 3x3 matrices
	* Elements:       Conversion of various descriptions of an orbit
	* Propagate:      Calculate the future/past state of a 2-body system
	* Shape:          Functions for getting the shape of an orbit

You can use it by compiling the source code in the mKOST directory, including the header files in your own code, and linking everything together.
